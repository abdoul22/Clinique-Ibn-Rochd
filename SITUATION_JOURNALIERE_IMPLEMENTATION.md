# Situation Journalière Module - Final Implementation

## Overview

Successfully implemented the "Situation Journalière" (Daily Cashier Situation) module for Clinique Ibn Rochd. This dynamic, service-based module provides a blank form that the cashier can fill in manually with daily receipts and doctor shares. The system automatically displays doctors with consultations on the selected date and their number of acts.

## What Has Been Implemented

### 1. Controller (Simplified)

**File:** `app/Http/Controllers/SituationJournaliereController.php`

Features:

-   ✅ `index()` method: Displays the report form with date filtering
-   ✅ Dynamic service loading from database
-   ✅ Automatic detection of doctors with transactions on selected date
-   ✅ Calculation of number of acts (actes)
-   ✅ Examination tracking
-   ✅ **NO automatic calculation of receipts or doctor shares** (manual entry only)

**Data Processing:**

-   Retrieves all services from the database
-   For each service, gets all `Caisse` transactions for the selected date
-   Groups transactions by doctor (médecin)
-   For each doctor, tracks:
    -   Examinations performed (with count)
    -   Number of acts (actes)
-   **Leaves Recettes and Part Médecin empty for manual entry**

### 2. Routes

**File:** `routes/web.php`

Routes for both superadmin and admin:

**Superadmin:**

-   GET `/superadmin/situation-journaliere` → index

**Admin:**

-   GET `/admin/situation-journaliere` → index

### 3. Dashboard Integration

**Dashboards (superadmin & admin):**

-   ✅ Added gradient card (violet → purple → fuchsia)
-   ✅ Links to the module

### 4. Main View

**File:** `resources/views/situation-journaliere/index.blade.php`

Features:

-   ✅ **Filter button** - visible and functional
-   ✅ **Print button** - visible and functional (🖨️ Imprimer)
-   ✅ Clean table layout for each service
-   ✅ **Empty input fields** for manual entry:
    -   Recettes (per doctor, per service)
    -   Part Médecin (per doctor, per service)
    -   Total Recettes (grand total)
    -   Total Parts Médecins (grand total)
    -   Restant Cabinet (grand total)
-   ✅ Pre-filled automatic data:
    -   Doctor names

    -   Number of acts
-   ✅ Service total rows

## Data Structure

Each service contains:

```php
[
    'service_name' => 'Service Name',
    'medecins' => [
        [
            'nom' => 'Doctor Name',
            'examens' => [
                'Examen 1' => 3,  // count
                'Examen 2' => 1
            ],
            'nombre_actes' => 4   // total acts
        ]
    ],
    'total_actes' => 4
]
```

## Database Queries Used

```php
// Get all services
Service::all()

// Get caisses for a service on selected date
Caisse::where('service_id', $service->id)
    ->whereDate('date_examen', $date)
    ->with(['examen', 'medecin'])
